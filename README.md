## Before you start
1. With your partner, begin by selecting either the beginner or advanced coding challenge, located in their respective files, `beginner.js` & `advanced.js`.
2. Read through the requirements of the problem carefully. Make sure you understand the problem statement, input, output, and any given constraints.

## Pair programming
When pair programming, there's often two roles, the Driver and the Navigator.

**The Driver**: The person writing code. They're responsible for typing in the code and implementing the actual logic to solve the problem.

**The Navigator**: The person guiding the driver. They don't write the code themselves, but they play a crucial role in the problem-solving process. They are responsible for understanding and clarifying the problem requirements, strategizing the solution, and sharing resources such as documentation and code snippets.

It's recommended to have one person writing the code (the driver) and the other person guiding (the navigator). The navigator will typically look up documentation and other helpful resources online and help strategize the solution. The Navigator should always be proactive and keep the conversation going.

## Tips
- **Communicate regularly.** As a pair, you should aim to discuss the problem and the potential solutions with one another.
- **Don't rush to write the code.** Start by discussing the problem and brainstorming possible approaches.
- **Don't be afraid to make mistakes or suggest wrong solutions.** The goal is to learn and improve together. Two heads are better than one!
- **Be respectful and patient with your partner.** Pair programming is a collaborative process.
- **Have fun!**

## Claiming your badge
Once you have completed the challenge, let your PairPVD host know so you can claim your badge on pairprogram.com. The badge code will be output to the terminal when you have all test cases passing!

## Share with the group
Knowledge sharing is one of the best ways to learn, which is why pair programming is so powerful in many settings. Make sure to walk through your solution with the rest of group so that others can learn from your approach!

# ðŸŽ‰Good luck, and happy coding!
